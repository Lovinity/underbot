                                    <p>Mettaton caught Frisk hiding in the cupboards of Sans and Papyrus' house one

                                    Determination (DT) is a stat we use in the Undertale Enhanced role play. DT is
                                    measured on a scale of 0 - 100. For humans, DT is how much will the human has at
                                    completing the game in the way they want to (example: genocide means the will to
                                    kill everyone, pacifist means the will not to harm anyone). For monsters, DT is the
                                    will to live / push onward to remove the barrier and go back to the Surface. DT can
                                    change over time throughout the role play depending on how the characters experience
                                    events, such as tragedy.

                            <p>Determination is used as a tool for developing a character's backstory and to add an
                                additional element to role play story telling. </p>
                            <p>Determination is also used as a secondary method for taking down the barrier. We know the
                                barrier can be taken down with human SOULs, but the monsters and humans might decide
                                they do not want to kill anyone [else]. Thus, they must try to find a way to break down
                                the barrier using the collective DT of all living characters. The barrier requires 2,000
                                total DT to give way. However, DT alone cannot break the barrier; the characters must
                                find a way to convert DT into a force to break down the barrier.</p>
                            <p>DT can be used in other ways as well. For example, DT determines whether or not Undyne
                                becomes Undying after death.</p>
